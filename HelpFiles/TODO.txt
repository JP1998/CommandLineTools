- implement some kind of lightweight pattern matching for Filtering files

- some default command such as:

  - bulk renaming files within a directory
    - having an option for the folder to rename the contained files of
    - having an option to filter files
    - having an option to rename everything but matches to a pattern
    - having an option to recursively rename within subdirectories
    - having an option to format the result name

  - password generator / manager
  - interpreter for brainfuck
  - interpreter for false

- a GUI that is more comfortable to use than the cli of Win7
  - giving the possibility of viewing / recalling history with arrow keys
//   - text-based but created with a window
//   - using streams to read / write (so System.out and Scanner may still be used)

// - refactoring:
//   - FilterMode:
//     - create lambdas from the anonymous classes within the enum-values
//   - FilterModeApplication:
//     - extract the default methods
//   - FileEncryptor:
//     - take its responsibility to load from and write to files (should be within CommonFileUtilities)
//     - rename FileEncryptor to a more general EncryptionService since it does not need to be used with files
//     - rename EncryptionResult to FileEncryptionResult
//     - make encrypt and decrypt public, and make it return a new type EncryptionResult

// - bulk de- and encrypting of files
//   - having an option for the folder to de- / encrypt the contained files
//   - having an option to filter files
//   - having an option to de- / encrypt everything but matches to a pattern
//   - having an option to recursively de- / encrypt within subdirectories
//   - having an option of where to save the output
//   - having an option to format the output files file names
//   - having an option for the used password
//   - deleting folders that may be eventually empty

//   - listing files within a directory
//     - having an option for the folder to list the contained files of
//     - having an option to format as a tree
//     - having an option to filter files
//     - having an option to list everything but matches to a pattern
//     - having an option to list folders
//     - having an option to recursively search within subdirectories
//     - having an option of how to format the output

// - make a command return a CommandExecutionResult (or similar object variable)
//   - makes it easier to extend commands later on
//   - makes it easier to implement an easy CLI in other environments (like a Swing- or JavaFX-window)

// - Change filenamingtemplates extension to include the point!
